# Advent of code 2023 puzzles

These are my solutions for each day. I don't do any refactors after I have the correct answers, so these are the first working versions. Still in C#. When it is possible I keep the part 1 and part 2 of the solution together. However when part 2 needs modification which affects the code of part 1, then only the final version will be uploaded (so the solution for part 2).

Day 1: more complicated than previous years but I am kinda proud of my simple part2 solution

Day 2: now I see more simplier ways to solve it but it was easier than Day 1

Day 3: maps are here again, my code is awful

Day 4: 

Day 5: Part2 might be not complete however it works for my input.

Day 6: Without any optimization the code runs fast

Day 7: Some tricks to simplify code (character replacement) 

Day 8: Part 2 was solved by hand and with an online LCM multiplier. But I commited a working solution.

Day 9: easy day, like derivation

Day 10: Interesting challenge, pipes needed some hand drawing to figure out how to count intersections

Day 11: Overcomplicate, wait too much to a slow solution then rewrite it in minutes
