# Advent of code 2024 puzzles

These are my solutions for each day. I don't do any refactors after I have the correct answers, so these are the first working versions. Still in C#. When it is possible I keep the part 1 and part 2 of the solution together. However when part 2 needs modification which affects the code of part 1, then only the final version will be uploaded (so the solution for part 2).

Day 1: usual LINQ solution for a quite easy first day

Day 2: multiple errors in part2: did not remove the last number, use the wrong LINQ function

Day 3: solve with regex, no bugs or tricky corner cases

Day 4: easy part 1, easy part 2 with a long debuging of a wrong index check (copy paste bug)

Day 5: ordering, no bugs

Day 6: worked without bugs, it is not optimalized (pt2 is a bit slow), copy parsing code from last year

Day 7: worked for the first time both part, 1st in the Trimble private board (1003 on global), yeah

Day 8: hard to understand the description, otherwise straightforward implementation

Day 9: different parsing for part2 (not usual). Part2 had a bug as I forgot one criteria (fastest in company board)

Day 10: similar puzzle was last year maybe. Code was simple and need only a minute to change for part 2.

Day 11: debugging for minutes while part2 is low, I used the example input. :( So I had to bring the kids to school and find this "bug" afterwards.

Day 12: not hard but needs a lot of coding for me (also school commute between part1 and part2)

Day 13: My approach was too complicated for part2. So I started solving it on paper and was able to write the correct equations. I was way too slow for part2. 

Day 14: Fun puzzle, I did the second part by printing it out and find the (unknown) pattern in the file, looking for lots of robot in one line (visual c :D).

Day 15: Xmas party, so today I did not get up early, part1 solved before lunch, part2 solved in the evening

Day 16: Path finding was easy. Part2 was more tricky, I tried different approaches and maybe overcomplicated.

Day 17: Good old IntComputer. Part1 was long to code but easy, part2 was interestin and I was not sure that my solution will work but eventually it worked. 

Day 18: An easier day 16

Day 19: Recursive solution. With cache it is fast enough.
