# Advent of code 2024 puzzles

These are my solutions for each day. I don't do any refactors after I have the correct answers, so these are the first working versions. Still in C#. When it is possible I keep the part 1 and part 2 of the solution together. However when part 2 needs modification which affects the code of part 1, then only the final version will be uploaded (so the solution for part 2).

Day 1: usual LINQ solution for a quite easy first day
Day 2: multiple errors in part2: did not remove the last number, use the wrong LINQ function
Day 3: solve with regex, no bugs or tricky corner cases
Day 4: easy part 1, easy part 2 with a long debuging of a wrong index check (copy paste bug)
